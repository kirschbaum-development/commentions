# Filament package rules
- Always add new migrations to [create_commentions_tables.php.stub](mdc:database/migrations/create_commentions_tables.php.stub) stub, don't create a new migration file.
## Testing
- We use Pest for testing. So, create tests following Pest conventions.
- Everytime you do changes to any php file, you have to run tests to verify everything works as expected.
- You can run tests with `pest`.
- Never use `uses(RefreshDatabase::class)` because it's already setup on [TestCase.php](mdc:tests/TestCase.php).

## Formatting
- Make sure you run `herd composer fix-style` command, after you do any change to php files.
